TreeGen README
==============

TreeGen is a program to generate code and data types to be used in a tree
structure. One example, and the reason TreeGen was created, is to generate
the C++ class nodes for an Abstract Syntax Tree, as used in a compiler front-end.

Status

At the moment, TreeGen is under initial development and is not intended for
mainstream use.
